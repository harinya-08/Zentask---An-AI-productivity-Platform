ZenTask AI

ZenTask AI is a modern, full-stack task management platform designed to enhance productivity through intelligent automation and a clean, user-centric interface. The application focuses on simplifying task planning and execution by combining traditional task management with AI-powered assistance.

Overview

The platform allows users to create, manage, and track tasks efficiently while providing intelligent support for planning and organization. ZenTask AI is built with a flexible architecture that supports both client-side execution and backend-driven workflows, ensuring ease of use as well as extensibility.

AI Capabilities

ZenTask AI integrates AI-powered brainstorming to help users transform high-level ideas into structured project plans. Users can request suggestions and task outlines, enabling faster planning and better clarity. The Magic Split feature further enhances productivity by automatically breaking complex tasks into smaller, actionable subtasks.

Application Flow

The application supports a dual-mode workflow. In local mode, all task operations run entirely in the browser for speed and simplicity. In backend mode, the application connects to a Python-based API, demonstrating clean frontend–backend integration and well-structured RESTful communication.

Design & User Experience

The user interface is designed with a modern glassmorphism aesthetic, focusing on visual clarity, smooth animations, and intuitive interactions. The UI emphasizes usability while maintaining a polished and professional look suitable for real-world applications.

Technical Implementation

The frontend is developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure responsiveness and maintainable component structure. The backend is built using FastAPI in Python, exposing lightweight and well-designed APIs for task operations. Tasks are stored using runtime persistence to keep the system simple and efficient.

Project Highlights

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in full-stack development, Python backend engineering, REST API design, UI/UX integration, and creative problem solving. ZenTask AI reflects the ability to deliver a complete, visually polished, and functional product within a limited development timeframe.
